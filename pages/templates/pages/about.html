						<p>For many years pigeons were used to send private messages to people. But today, to send private and confidential information a pigeon is not enough. We upgraded the pigeon for a hawk - it's stronger, faster and will protect all of your messages better.</p>
						<p>We know that sometimes it's difficult to explain how to encrypt messages or how to install that software to protect confidential information. That's why we've created Hawkpost - a place where people can send you sensible information in an easy and secure way.</p>
						<p>This project was made at Whitesmith's Hackathon during our company retreat. The aim of this hackathon was to launch a side-project in 24h.</p>
						<p> You can read more about the project in our FAQ at the bottom of our <a class="text-blue" href="https://hawkpost.co/">landing page</a>.</p>
